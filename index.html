            The late HON. Mwai Kibaki served as the third President of Kenya from 2002 to 2013. 
            Born on November 15, 1931, in Gatuyaini village, Nyeri County, he was a 
            distinguished economist, politician, and statesman who transformed Kenya's 
            political and economic landscape.

            The late HON. Mwai Kibaki is remembered for his strong leadership, economic reforms, and the 
            landmark introduction of free primary education program in 2003, which 
            increased enrollment from 5.9 million to over 7 million children. His 
            administration oversaw significant economic growth, with Kenya's GDP growing 
            at an average of 4-7% annually during his leadership.

            A Cambridge University graduate with a degree in Economics, Public Finance, 
            and Political Science, HON. Mwai Kibaki served in various ministerial positions under 
            Presidents Jomo Kenyatta and Daniel arap Moi before ascending to the presidency. 
            He was instrumental in Kenya's transition to multiparty democracy and is 
            credited with restoring economic stability, fighting corruption, and 
            promoting national unity after the 2007-2008 post-election violence.
